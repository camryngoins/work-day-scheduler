# work-day-scheduler

I was given the challenge of creating a Work Day Scheduler through MSU Coding Bootcamp using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## Description 

This is a simple calendar application that allows a use to create their schedule and save events for each hour of the day in the time blocks. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When a user clicks on the time block, they can then enter in an event and click the save button for that specific timeblock. The event will then be saved into local storage, and when the user refreshes the page, then the saved event will persist.
